        I also recommend Lost in Space, a TV Show full of action and adventure.
        It is about Will, a boy with 2 sisters, Judy and Penny, and his parents.
        His family gets lost in space and Will meets an Alien Robot on a cold planet.
        There is a doctor with dark secrets.
        Danger follows Will's family where ever they go.
